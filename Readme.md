# How to unite and manage the world by a natural/logical religion

No other re-ligion (= back-binding [one etymological analysis] to some ideas to rely on for humans) is necessary for a society, but only reasoned about principles: reflection, symmetry, cooperative construction (by too many CAs -> 1CA).

Evolved religions like Christianity also abide to following principles. Their followers do reflect about the world, they are in search of beauty (symmetry), they try to establish one text as core of their religion. Uncovering an abstract core of every human society is our goal here for the betterment of education and world management. (Respect for every evolved religion is granted, but having different people adhering to different religions is not a good way to start thinking about a unity of humanity -- despite the potential of tolerance in various religions. ) 

 
## Natural principles
cf. reflexivity, symmetry here (math is natural): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation

### the MIND and its reflection (also see below /human event machine/)
- reflection as most basic principle in nature (including ourselves: one thought coming around in the human event machine: MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS!) including physics: double slit experiment etc.
  - unfolding education from here:
    - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
      - how much more simple is education with knowledge of math and logic arising out of reflection? (encodings in lambda calculus) Remains to be seen, but the ones in charge of producing teachers at university, i.e. professors, should be way less confused.
      - LESS CONFUSION at the core of education
- AIMING at X (so wie man mit den Augen etwas fokussiert, so fokussiert/zielt auch der Geist, das Gehirn)
- having the identity: f(x) = x + some JUDGEMENT (is it worth to continue aiming at X, or: keeping it in mind as a valid fact?):
  -     Is X attractive? Ok, go for it, I want to have this beautiful thing, person etc.
  - or: Is X a valid fact making sense with other facts I collected in my memory?
    - Yes, well done brain! (beauty,   no doubt)
    - No? Confusion!        (ugliness,    doubt)

### the BODY in symmetry
The next more complicated natural principle after reflection is symmetry, observable in many natural phaenomena, too. (e.g. snowflakes under microscope, animals and their symmetric axis)
- bestform of animals in general means to be fully symmetric
- practicing symmetry: same action, both sides


## Cultural principle 

### Cooperative construction in 1CA

What kind of principles can we rely while living/working together? /Natural/ principles like the ones above are impossible to apply, we are in the realm of /culture/, we need to govern it somehow.

What's the best way to govern?

Our world got so complicated, so many nations evolving, so many attempts makings sense of people's characters, viewpoints... (it's not only about religions). 

- let's make one plan (= one data model [1DM] or  one central authority [1CA])
  - let's call it: [[./world-wide-wished-for-things.org]] (humans after all are basically the same everywhere)
  - the real problem in the world: *too many CAs* of nations and other players, not willing to give in to one CA
    - moving to 1CA while keeping nations/ppl proud/happy is the logical conclusion of the *too many CAs* problem
- then implement some important goals of this plan, gather feedback, optimize the plan
  - rinse and repeat to have some paradise won in time


### Notes on "Was ist der Mensch?" / what is a human being?

** evolutionary big picture vs. own bio record/career/wrong and right actions in bio record
Seeing yourself as a result of evolution, random development of animals on this our earth, with humans as a kind of animal developing very sophisticated languages -- instead of being only your biographical record of family, friends, and foes.


** human event machine / thinking (reflection) about events (inner/outer) / AI
- personal vs. social intelligence
  - mutual enrichment of the personal and the social (growing language, growing tradition, growing brain)
    - i.e. our cultural evolution, what makes us human!
    - cultural evol. vs. natural one
- ONE CYCLE, ONE THOUGHT (sequential, concept of event machine from programming languages [PL] makes sense, i.e. node.js event loop): what do we do with it?
  - constructing coherent "picture" of the world we peceive
  - memory of coherent thoughts we do not doubt (how do we commit information to our memory? how is it encoded? Does Church encoding play a role?)
  - memory of thoughts we do doubt (plus: undecidable ones, anyway: non associative to valid facts collected)
    - makes our thinking slower by making us inclined to revalidate already established coherent facts (to keep our world view intact/coherent)
  - PANDORA'S BOX:
    - free -- but mechanical -- will of the human machine :: adding new ideas to our set of coherent thoughts / our valid personal record
    - some (un-)safety in big picture: random evolution on this planet, social intelligence, an ABIOGRAPHICAL record we miss most of the time
